# UNIVERSITY STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A OOP based approach in 2 languages for the same problem statement.
- Java
- CPP 17

The problem constraints and requirements are mentioned in the PDF file.
The Java implementation was a part of the mandatory course as a assessment project. [Course : OOP with Java : 21IS4C03]

The CPP implementation was done as a part of the learning process and to understand the differences between the two languages.

Thank you.
